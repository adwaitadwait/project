      <h1>The MTA Tried To Improve Outer Borough Bus Service, But They've Only Made It Worse</h1>
      <h3>The MTA Bus Company introduced articualted, or twin-carraige, buses on three high-volume routes that connect the outer-boroughs to key locations in order to save money and improve service. Since then, commuters say service has only gotten
        worse and they think agency just doesn't care
        <h4>By Adwait</h4>

        <div class="para">
          <p>On a cold Wednesday evening in November, Maria Restrepo and 70 other commuters, armed with grocery bags, office briefcases and shopping bags, stood patiently in line on Roosevelt Avenue, in Queens, waiting for the Q12
            bus to take
            them
            home.</p>

          <p>Restrepo, 65, has been a regular on this route ever since she retired from her job in a make-up factory, three years ago, where she made cosmetic products like blush and eye-shadow. The Q12 is the only direct public transportation
            connection between her home, on 161st Street, and Main Street in Downtown Flushing.</p>

          <p>At 5:30 p.m. a new articulated (double carriage) Q12 bus pulled up to the curb, the line slowly began boarding the bus. Vestrapo, who was towards the end of the line was visibly tired and just wanted to get home before it got too cold.
          </p>

          <p>By the time she got to the door, the driver signalled her not to board and suggested she not swipe her metrocard. The bus had reached its full capacity, leaving Restrepo and another 15 people still waiting in line.</p>

          <p>“When I saw these double-buses, I thought they were supposed to solve this problem,” said Restrepo. She stood there, in the cold, for another 10 minutes till the next bus arrived. </p>

          <p>“It’s like this everyday.”</p>

        <p> In October this year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority made service changes to three high-volume routes in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. On each route they increased headways, reduced the number of stops, and introduced
          double-carriage—known as articualted—buses on the Q12, B38, and Bx35.</p>

        <p>The Q12 connects Eastern Queens—a public-transit desert—and Flushing market, the B38 is the only public-transit option for residents on the outer edges of Ridgewood and Maspeth, and the Bx35 is one of the few lines that connects the
          East-West corridor between Washington Heights and the South Bronx.</p>

    <div id="page-wrap">
      <div class="para">
        <p> As the days get shorter, commuters are convinced these changes have not yielded the benefits they were promised. They’re left stranded at stops without real-time updates and wait times that regularly exceed 25 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s a lot of poor people who use this route, and I see them waiting for an hour outside the shopping center the route passes through,” Gonzalez said. After the MTA decided to strip the bus stops along this route of their schedules,
          Gonzalez
          has helped countless eldery passengers by showing them updates on phone.</p>

        <p>Gonzalez, ad adjunct lecturer of Mathematics at Lehman College, has been riding the Bx35 since he was a teeneager. It was once the best way to commute to his sister’s apartment, who he makes a point to see every week. But since the
          articulated
          buses were introduced, he’s had to explain to her why he never shows up on time.</p>

        <p>“I know about the app because I'm younger. So I was checking the time and got frustrated because it’s saying the bus will be there at 12:55. I check the time, ‘okay, five more minutes,’” Gonazelz said.</p>

        <p>“And then it said 1:15. So then 15 minutes pass and nothing. And another 15 minutes pass and still nothing. At this point everyone is frustrated and crossing the road to get to another line. We’re just blindly waiting with no place to even
          sit.”</p>

        <p>The perennially “cash-stripped” MTA justified this decision on two counts. First it said these changes would save them $2.4 million, while their debt could potentially rise to $40 billion by the end of 2022 and second, decreasing road
          congestion, which in turn would speed up commutes.</p>

        <p> In a public statement earlier this year, MTA Bus boss Craig Cipriano said this decision was “cost-effective,” and would result in better service for customers. MTA representative Amanda Kwan confirmed these changes were made with a
          specific
          goal in mind.</p>

        <p> “It’s no secret that the MTA is in a dire financial situation, and we are required to balance our operating budget,” Kwan said in a statement. “Today we announced that we’re increasing service on routes that benefit tens of thousands of
          riders,
          while saving money. Who wouldn’t be in favor of that?”
        </p>

        <p>Matt Josephson, 37, an IT engineer from Ridgewood, has the B38 route imprinted in his mind.</p>

        <p> Josephson grew up in Ridgewood, and has been riding the B38 line for nearly two decades. First as a high-schooler, who’d often make excuses to get out of school early, and now as an IT professional in working in Greenpoint.</p>

        <p> In all these years, Josephson said he’d made friends along the way. Familiar faces, who had become his “rider friends.” But ever since the route started using articulated buses, not only has his wait at the stop increased, he’s also lost
          his
          friends in the crowd.</p>

        <p> “When you see a bunch of faces in the morning that you don’t know, you know the MTA has screwed up,” said Josephson. “There are holdovers from the previous bus, waiting for the next one. And now, everyone’s like, ‘okay this is usual.’”
        </p>

        <p> The B38 for many Ridgewood residents is the first leg of public transport. For some it’s a direct line to downtown Brooklyn, while others use it to get to the nearest L train subway stop.</p>

        <p> The service begins on Metropolitan Avenue, in Ridgewood, right outside the Linden Hill Cemetery and the nearest MTA subway station, Jefferson Street, is a mile away. More if you live north of Metropolitan avenue. However, majority of the
          stops
          on the route, especially running West on DeKalb Avenue in Bed-Stuy do not have benches or a shelter.</p>

        <p> “It’s a lot of older people getting into the city, and the usual gamut of children and young adults. The route goes through so many different neighborhoods, you really see everyone on the bus,” said Johnson.</p>

        <p> On November 4, 2019, I rode the B38 bus from its first to last stop. I started at 9 am and completed the route in one hour and 10 minutes. The route is roughly 8 miles, making the average speed of the bus just over 7 mph.</p>

        <p> According to advocates at TransitCenter, a non-profit transit agency, buses must operate at 15 mph on city streets in order to achieve maximum efficiency. However, the B38 never reaches this speed because of its route.</p>

        <p> Travelling west, the B38 runs straight on Dekalb Avenue once it twists and turns through narrow, two-lane, streets in Ridgewood. On countless occasions, just as the bus was gaining momentum — it never managed to exceed 16 mph, for more
          than
          20
          seconds — it was impeded by a cast of usual New York City suspects: delivery vans and trucks blocking bike lanes, double parked cars and construction vehicles. </p>

        <p> Between Marcus Garvey Boulevard and Bedford Avenue, in Bed-Stuy, the bus was slower than the pedestrians on the sidewalk as it maneuvered around parked trucks, which belonged to a film set.</p>

        <p> Danny Pearlstein, the Policy and Communications Director at Riders Alliance, views service cuts as a “death spiral,” in times of dwindling bus ridership in the city. However, he does find benefits with articulated buses.</p>

        <p> “Reduction in the number of bus stops, we view as positive,” said Pearlstein. “The less time stopped, they spend more time in motion and overall New York has some closely placed bus stops and ultimately that’s something that needs to
          change.”
        </p>

        <p> Pearlstein also added that a high-functioning and efficient system makes it easier for people to get out and participate in the “economic activity of the city.”</p>

        <p> “It’s essential that the bus creates access for people who live in one community and must travel to another, for work or whatever reason and making cuts in bus service actively frustrate people from gaining these opportunities,” said
          Pearlstein.</p>

        <p> Even among MTA bus drivers, this decision has raised concerns. A representative for the Transport Workers Union Local 100’s bus division, the city’s largest union of MTA workers, said increased headways aren’t enhancements, but cuts,
          which
          eventually diminish ridership.</p>

        <p> The MTA’s next articulated bus will be introduced on the the B46 route in Brooklyn in early 2020, and has already faced opposition from politicians and elected officials including Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, Councilmembers, and
          Transportation Committee members, Rafael L. Espinal Jr. and Ydanis Rodriguez, and state Assemblywoman Latrice Walker.</p>

        <p> MTA bus drivers most recent protest regarding the reduced headways was in Brooklyn on November 30, outside the Flatbush depot. A group of 40 drivers shouted “no service cuts,” while others held up banners that read, “less busses, longer
          waits.”
          Walker said that while discussing the MTA budget in Albany, she would show a “commitment to the bus operators.”</p>

        <p> The MTA has not provided an exact date on which the articulated buses will be introduced on the B46 route, but the mere thought of it, alongside the current situations in other parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx has everyone
          worried.
        </p>

        <p> “When you cut bus services, you are destroying the heart of the city,” Adams said.
